I’m a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the **University of Maryland, College Park**, and a pre-doctoral research fellow at the **National Library of Medicine (NIH)**.  
My research combines natural language processing, biomedical informatics, and AI safety to build clinical language models that are **accurate, safe, and robust** in real-world healthcare applications.

### Research Focus

- **Domain-Augmented Language Models** – Enhance biomedical reasoning in LLMs using retrieval, structured knowledge (e.g., gene databases, ontologies), and tool integration (e.g., clinical calculators, genomic indexing).

- **Clinical AI for Real-World Use** – Develop interactive systems for patient-trial matching, diagnostic imaging, and genomic analysis that are both explainable and efficient for clinical workflows.

- **Safe and Trustworthy Medical LLMs** – Investigate hallucination, bias, adversarial attacks, and privacy risks in clinical LLMs; design decoding-time safety mechanisms and benchmark evaluation frameworks.

### Awards

- **NIH Director’s Challenge Award**
- **NIH Predoctoral Visiting Program Award**
