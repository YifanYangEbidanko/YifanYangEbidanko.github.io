### 🔬 Research Focus
**Medical LLM Safety** · **Contextual-Augmented LLMs** · **Clinical Task Automation**

| Theme | What I do | Representative Work |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Medical LLM Safety** | Study bias, robustness, adversarial risk, & privacy leakage in clinical settings; design inference-time guards. | **MedGuard** &mdash; expert-verified benchmark built on 5 safety principles × 10 clinical dimensions. |
| **Contextual-Augmented LLMs** | Combine retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with targeted fine-tuning; let models call domain calculators & perform multi-hop reasoning. | On-the-fly risk-score calculator; gene-centric reasoning with RLHF. |
| **Clinical Task Automation** | Build end-to-end systems that save clinician time while retaining transparency. | **TrialGPT** (NIH pilot): zero-shot patient-to-trial matching with criterion-level explanations. |
