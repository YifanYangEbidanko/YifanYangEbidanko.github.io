## 👋 Hi, I’m **Yifan Yang**

I’m a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at **University of Maryland, College Park** and a pre-doctoral research fellow at the **National Library of Medicine (NIH)**.  
My research lies at the intersection of **natural-language processing, clinical informatics, and AI safety**—with a mission to make large language models (LLMs) _trustworthy, private, and equitable_ for real-world healthcare.

### 🔬 Research Focus

| Theme | What I do | Representative Work |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| **Medical LLM Safety** | Study bias, robustness, adversarial risk, & privacy leakage in clinical settings; design inference-time guards. | **MedGuard** &mdash; expert-verified benchmark built on 5 safety principles × 10 clinical dimensions. |
| **Contextual-Augmented LLMs** | Combine retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with targeted fine-tuning; let models call domain calculators & perform multi-hop reasoning. | On-the-fly risk-score calculator; gene-centric reasoning with RLHF. |
| **Clinical Task Automation** | Build end-to-end systems that save clinician time while retaining transparency. | **TrialGPT** (NIH pilot): zero-shot patient-to-trial matching with criterion-level explanations. |
