</p>

Iâ€™m a final-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at the **University of Maryland, College Park**, and a pre-doctoral research fellow at the **National Library of Medicine (NIH)**.  
My research combines natural-language processing, clinical informatics, and AI safety to make large-language models **trustworthy, private, and equitable** in real-world healthcare.

### Research Focus

- **Medical LLM Safety** â€“ Study bias, robustness, adversarial risk, and privacy leakage in clinical settings; design inference-time guards. 

- **Contextual-Augmented LLMs** â€“ Blend retrieval-augmented generation with targeted fine-tuning, enabling models to leverage domain knowledge for better performance on biomedical tasks.

- **Clinical Task Automation** â€“ Build end-to-end systems that save clinician time while maintaining transparency.
